| Column Name   | Type    |

id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

//ANSWER

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather AS w1, Weather AS w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate,w2.recordDate)=1 AND w1.temperature > w2.

// DATEDIFF - used to calculate the diff b/w dates

SELECT w1.id 
FROM Weather AS w1,Weather AS w2
WHERE w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

//DATE_ADD used to add day/month/year in date
